# Professional Portfolio

## This repository is a professional portfolio to showcase my projects with potential employers. I am actively building this portfolio as part of the bootcamp that I am attending. It will have links to GitHub repositories as well as deployed projects. This is not a responsive site. The newer responsive site is located [here](https://github.com/aritse/responsive-portfolio).
