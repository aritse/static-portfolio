        Web developers are found working in various types of organizations, including large corporations and governments, small and medium-sized companies, or
        alone as freelancers. Some web developers work for one organization as a permanent full-time employee, while others may work as independent consultants,
        or as contractors for an agency or at home personal use. Web developers typically handle both server-side and front-end logic.

        Modern web applications often contain three or more tiers, and depending on the size of the team a developer works on, he or she may specialize in one
        or more of these tiers - or may take a more interdisciplinary role. A web developer is usually classified as a Front-end web development or a Back-End
        Web Developer. For example, in a two-person team, one developer may focus on the technologies sent to the client such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, ReactJs
        or AngularJS and on the server-side frameworks (such as Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, ASP, ASP.NET, Node.js) used to deliver content and scripts to the
        client. Meanwhile, the other developer might focus on the interaction between server-side frameworks, the webserver, and a database system.

        There are no formal educational or licensure requirements to become a web developer. However, many colleges and trade schools offer coursework in web
        development. There are also many tutorials and articles, which teach web development, freely available on the web - for example Basic JavaScript Even
        though there are no formal educational requirements, dealing with web developing projects requires those who wish to be referred to as web developers to
        have advanced knowledge/skills in: HTML/XHTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. Server/client side architecture like all or some of the above mentioned.
