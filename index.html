        Web developers are found working in various types of organizations,
        including large corporations and governments, small and medium-sized
        companies, or alone as freelancers. Some web developers work for one
        organization as a permanent full-time employee, while others may work as
        independent consultants, or as contractors for an agency or at home
        personal use. Web developers typically handle both server-side and
        front-end logic.

        Modern web applications often contain three or more tiers, and depending
        on the size of the team a developer works on, he or she may specialize
        in one or more of these tiers - or may take a more interdisciplinary
        role. A web developer is usually classified as a Front-end web
        development or a Back-End Web Developer. For example, in a two-person
        team, one developer may focus on the technologies sent to the client
        such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, ReactJs or AngularJS and on the
        server-side frameworks (such as Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, ASP,
        ASP.NET, Node.js) used to deliver content and scripts to the client.
        Meanwhile, the other developer might focus on the interaction between
        server-side frameworks, the webserver, and a database system.
